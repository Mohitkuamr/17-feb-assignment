    "Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in flexible,\n",
    "JSON-like documents rather than traditional tables with rows and columns. This makes it easy to handle \n",
    "unstructured and semi-structured data, and allows for more expressive data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "High availability and scalability: MongoDB is designed to be highly available and scalable,\n",
    "making it a good choice for applications with high traffic and large volumes of data. It supports \n",
    "automatic sharding and replica sets for automatic failover and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB provides a rich query language with support for ad-hoc queries, text search, \n",
    "and aggregation operations. This allows for complex queries to be performed easily and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports a variety of indexing options, including compound indexes, text indexes,\n",
    "and geospatial indexes. This allows for fast query performance even on large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\n",
    "Schema flexibility: MongoDBs dynamic schema allows for easy schema evolution without requiring downtime\n",
    "or complex migration scripts. This makes it ideal for agile development environments where requirements \n",
    "may change rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\n",
    "Built-in aggregation framework: MongoDBs built-in aggregation framework allows for complex data \n",
    "transformations and analytics to be performed within the database itself. This can significantly reduce\n",
    "the amount of data that needs to be transferred to other systems for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\n",
    "Automatic sharding and load balancing: MongoDB automatically shards data across multiple servers,\n",
    "allowing for horizontal scaling and improved performance. It also supports automatic load balancing, \n",
    "making it easy to add or remove servers as needed."
